# OOP-Excercise
This is an Excercise to get to get to know with Object Oriented Programming in Python.
I had to do this assignment as a part of my course "Advanced Python Programming" on https://maktabkhooneh.org

Problem: 
Write a program in which there is a football class that inherits traits from the human class.
The plan is to create 22 soccer objects first, then assign the following player names to each object. Using the random and inheritance method, divide these 22 names between teams A and B, and finally print the name of each player with the name of the team in which it is located.
Names of players:
Hossein - Maziar - Akbar - Nima - Mehdi - Farhad - Mohammad - Khashayar - Milad - Mostafa - Amin - Saeed - Pouya - Pouria - Reza - Ali - Behzad - Soheil - Behrooz - Shahrooz - Saman - Mohsen
